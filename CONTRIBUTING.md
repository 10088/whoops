If you want to get your hands dirty, great! Here's a couple of steps/guidelines:

- Fork/clone this repo, and update dev dependencies using Composer

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:filp/whoops.git
$ cd whoops
$ composer install --dev
```

- Create a new branch for your feature or fix

```bash
$ git checkout -b feature/flames-on-the-side
```

- Add your changes & tests for those changes (in `tests/`).
- Remember to stick to the existing code style as best as possible. When in doubt, follow `PSR-2`.
- Send me a pull request!

If you don't want to go through all this, but still found something wrong or missing, please
let me know, and/or **open a new issue report** so that I or others may take care of it.
